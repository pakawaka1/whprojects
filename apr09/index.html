    I enjoy long,<span class=
    'adjective'>[ADJECTIVE]</span> walks on the beach, getting <span class='verb'>[VERB]</span> in the rain and serendipitous encounters with <span='plural'>[PLURAL NOUN]</span> . I really like pi√±a coladas mixed with <span='liquid'>[LIQUID]</span>, and romantic, candle-lit <span='plural'>[PLURAL NOUN]</span>. I am well-read from Dr. Seuss to <span='famous'>[FAMOUS PERSON]</span>. I travel frequently, especially to <span='place'>[PLACE </span>, when I am not busy with work. (I am a <span='occupation'>[OCCUPATION]</span>.) I am looking for <span='noun'>[NOUN]</span> and beauty in the form of a <span='nantionality'>[NATIONALITY]</span> goddess. She should have the physique of <span='celebrity'>[FEMALE CELEBRITY]</span> and the <span='noun'>[NOUN]</span> of <span='friend'>[FEMALE FRIEND]</span>. I would prefer if she knew how to cook, clean, and wash my <span='plural'>[PLURAL NOUN]</span>. I know I'm not very attractive in my picture, but it was taken<span class='number'></span> [NUMBER]</span> days ago, and I have since become more <span='adjective'>[ADJECTIVE]</span>.
